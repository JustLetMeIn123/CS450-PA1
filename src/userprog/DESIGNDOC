                          ARGUMENT PASSING

                          ================



---- DATA STRUCTURES ----



>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or

>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.



---- ALGORITHMS ----



>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do

>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?



---- RATIONALE ----



>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?



>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name

>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this

>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.
